# CSS Specificity Bug

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue related to CSS specificity.  A more specific selector is unexpectedly overridden by a less specific one. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic code, while `solution.css` offers a corrected version.

**Problem:** The expected styling is not applied due to an unexpected specificity conflict.

**Solution:** The issue is resolved by adjusting selector specificity to ensure the intended style is applied correctly.
